# Quality UNIT TEST TASK

My testing taks

## Technologies used:

HTML SCSS JAVASCRIPT REACT

### REACT modules & HOOKS:

- REACT BOOTSTRAP (to help with responsivity)
- REACT TRANSITION GROUP
- REACT COUNT UP
- useRef, useState, useEffect (useRef for loading animation on benefits section, state and effect for loading data to chat section)

### Some extra features

- Chat application with transition effect
- After rendering a site one of four sample chats is fetched from external server and embeded to site (you can resfresh to read them all :) )
- When numbers in benefits enter viewport, count up animation is fired :)
